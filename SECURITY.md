# Security Policy

Thanks for checking my security policy. As with any website on the web, there may be something that can be considered a security vulnerability in the code.
This policy helps you report security issues in the right way, so I can deal with them in a timely fashion.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security issues on my email address [willem.meints@gmail.com](mailto:willem.meints@gmail.com).
I'll try to get back to you within one day with an answer as to how I'm going to address the issue.
